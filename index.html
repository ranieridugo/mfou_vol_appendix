        <li><a href="page1_ccfe.html">1. Goodness of covariance fit (exact estimation)</a></li>
        contains additional evidence of the goodness of fit of our model to the data by showing empirical and theoretical cross-covariances with estimates according to Section 5.1. </p> 
        <li><a href="page2_ccfl.html">2. Empirical evidence of asymptotic regime</a></li>
        contains plots of the auto and cross-covariances as functions of suitable powers of the lags, which, according to the asymptotic relationship, should be linear.</p>  
        <li><a href="page3_esta.html">3. Estimates in the asymptotic regime</a></li>
        presents estimates of the model in the small alpha regime, where we employ asymptotic auto and cross-covariances as conditions in the estimation procedure.</p>
        <li><a href="page4_ccfa.html">4. Goodness of covariance fit (asymptotic regime)</a></li>
        contains additional evidence of the goodness of fit of our model in the asymptotic regime to the data by showing empirical and theoretical cross-covariances with estimates in line with Section 5.2. </p> 
        <li><a href="page5_estc.html">5. Estimates in the causal regime</a></li>
        contains estimates of the model in the causal regime, where eta is constrained to be a function of rho, H1 and H2. </p> 
        <li><a href="page6_ccfc.html">6. Goodness of covariance fit (causal regime)</a></li>
        contains evidence of the goodness of fit of our model in the causal regime (used in the spillover analysis) to the data by showing empirical and theoretical cross-covariances. </p>
